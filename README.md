## Abstract

Nowadays, 3D models are widely used in various industries such as architecture, engineering,
gaming, and film production. With the increasing demand for 3D models, 3D marketplaces have
become popular platforms for buying and selling these models. However, creating a 3D model from
scratch can be a time-consuming and challenging task for some users. To address this issue, our project
aims to provide a 3D model marketplace with a 3D reconstruction service. This service allows users to
upload 2D images of an object and receive a 3D model of that object in return. The 3D models created
by the reconstruction service will be available for purchase on the marketplace.
